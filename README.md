<h4 align='center'>Employee Prediction Analysis with Scikit-learn.</h4>
Being able to rely on your team members is critical to success in any environment and even the most humble role can become the bottleneck that halts production, damaging morale and causing unforseen difficulties. Onboarding new additions and adjusting to new workflows takes time and resources: wouldn't it be great to see these roadblocks coming and be able to plan for them?

In this project I've used Python and scikit-learn to conduct employee turnover analysis to assess the churn within an organization, in an effort to predict and 
reduce future employee turnover. Wages, incentives, workload, satisfaction and absenteeism - by modeling these variable interactions using Decision Trees and Random Forest, we can identify the key variables that play a crucial role in retaining team members. Interactive graphical controls via Jupyter widgets allows the the plots to be modified on the fly as we tune our model, and the results are generated in real time.</p>
